              ‚ÄúThe big question about how people behave,‚Äù says Warren Buffett,
              ‚Äúis whether they‚Äôve got an inner scorecard or an outer scorecard.
              It helps if you can be satisfied with an inner scorecard.‚Äù To make
              his point, Buffett often asks a simple question: Would you rather
              be the world‚Äôs greatest lover, but have everyone think you‚Äôre the
              world‚Äôs worst lover? Or would you rather be the world‚Äôs worst
              lover but have everyone think you‚Äôre the world‚Äôs greatest lover?
            </p>

            <p>
              Comparing ourselves to others allows them to drive our behavior.
              This type of comparison is between you and someone else. Sometimes
              it‚Äôs about something genetic, like wishing to be taller, but more
              often it‚Äôs about something the other person is capable of doing
              that we wish we could do as well. Maybe Sally writes better
              reports than you, and maybe Bob has a happier relationship with
              his spouse than you do. Sometimes this comparison is motivating
              and sometimes it‚Äôs destructive.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can be anything but you can‚Äôt be everything. When we compare
              ourselves to others, we‚Äôre often comparing their best features
              against our average ones. It‚Äôs like being right-handed and trying
              to play an instrument with your left hand. Not only do we
              naturally want to be better than them, the unconscious realization
              that we are not often becomes self-destructive.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p class="mb-0">
                There is one thing that you‚Äôre better at than other people:
                being you. This is the only game you can really win.
              </p>

                <cite title="Source Title">Ashish</cite>
              </footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              When you stop comparing between people and focus internally, you
              start being better at what really matters: being you. It‚Äôs simple
              but not easy.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most important things in life are measured internally.
              Thinking about what matters to you is hard. Playing to someone
              else‚Äôs scoreboard is easy, that‚Äôs why a lot of people do it. But
              winning the wrong game is pointless and empty. You get one life.
              Play your own game.
            </p>
